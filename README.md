# My First HTML Website
"
About this project : 
This is my first attempt at building a website using pure HTML and CSS. Itâ€™s a basic, static webpage designed to practice and showcase fundamental web development skills.

Features:
Basic HTML structure (headers, paragraphs, images, links).
Simple CSS for styling.
Responsive layout (optional if you've used media queries).
Future Plans:
Add more pages.
Improve design and responsiveness.
Experiment with JavaScript for interactivity.
